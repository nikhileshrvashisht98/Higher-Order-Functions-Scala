Q2. Create another class and write at least 2 functions where at least one function is a higher order function â€“ ie this function takes a function as a parameter. Your higher order function should do something useful. Just a higher order function that take in a function as a parameter but does nothing the input or does something trivial.



Q3. Using Scala, write a class of your choice. The class must have at least two (2) fields and two methods/functions. Create two instances (objects) of this class in the main. Using the object created, print the fields and call the method/function at least once.
